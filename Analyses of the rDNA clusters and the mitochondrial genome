The following command line sequence was used for parts of the analysis of the rDNA clusters as well as of the mitochondrial genome of Y. lipolytica DSM 3286. The sequence was used to identify reads that harbor specific features.

1. Conversion of the fastq files obtained from the ONT sequencing runs to fasta files:

  sed -n '1~4s/^@/>/p;2~4p' ONT_run_x.fastq > ONT_run.fasta
  
2. Creation of a BLAST database of the sequencing reads:

  makeblastdb -in ONT_run_x.fasta -dbtype nucl -parse_seqids
  
3. Search for reads with specific features with suitable query sequences (such as the cox1 gene of YALI2 for filtering for mitochondrial reads and the 18S sequence for filtering for rDNA reads; bioproject PRJNA641784):

  blastn -db ONT_run_x.fasta -query query_y_sequence.fasta -outfmt '6 qseqid sseqid pident qstart qend length qlen' > query_y_reads_from_ONT_run_x.txt
  
4. Extraction of the identified reads from the fasta file of the specific ONT sequencing run:

  grep -A1  -f  query_y_reads_from_ONT_run_x.txt ONT_run_x.fasta > query_y_reads.fasta
  

For subsequent analyses both the text files from step 3 and the fasta files from step 4 have been used. Results were visualized with OriginLab software. For detailed analyses, the feature annotation tool of Geneious PrimeÂ® 2020.1.2 and the MUSCLE and MAUVE plugins were used.
